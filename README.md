# .dat wire

**.dat wire** is a monorepo for the [trade-wire](https://github.com/gregtandiono/trade-wire) project. I'm not happy with how I designed the `trade-wire` project, so this is a full rewrite with microservice design implementation. 

The project is *100%* written in Go.

## Tests

To run existing tests simply run: `go test -v ./...` for now.
I will have to abstract test scripts for different services.


## Design

*note: I'll insert some sort of graph here*
